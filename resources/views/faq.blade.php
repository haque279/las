                                                    Your bank has a duty to treat you fairly and there are no grounds for them to ask for the mortgage to be repaid or to change the payments  as a result of a refund being sought. However, if we identify a mortgage overcharge on the part of your lender and you are entitled to a refund, your payments may decrease as the lender will be required to apply the correct interest and charges.

                                                    Legally the banks could have argued that some refund claims are statute barred.  However a new period of Statutory Limitations starts from the date the banks have acknowledge overcharging has occured. Legal advise is recommended where uncertainty exists.

If we find you are entitled to a refund and your home was repossessed then you are probably also be entitled to substantial compensation depending on the circumstances.

The bank should refund you immediately however in cases where compensation is not acceptable to the customer and litigation is necessary this can much longer. It is worth bearing in mind that the Central Bank have stated that “consumers who receive a payment from their bank can cash their cheque safe in the knowledge that they can still appeal the amount they have been awarded”

Your account details are scrutinised through specialized Loan forensic software designed to uncover overcharging. The final report will show the daily movements of your account, the amount and what type of overcharging occurred if any. It will show interest rate changes, compounding interest on interest, and all offset account benefits from the date of the error to the refund date.
